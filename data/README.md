## Copyright Notification

We reformat and merge fatigue testing records from SNL/MSU/DOE, OptiMat, UPWIND, and FACT databases into a single database with careful considerations, including filtering invalid entries, rename variables, fix improper calculations in the records, to obtain clean and consistent data to fit machine 
learning usages. We leave the original format ("2019_SNL_MSU_DOE_Composite-Materials-Database_Wind_29pt0.xlsx" and "Optidat UPWIND 28_3_2017.xls") in the folder. Any derived database should be directly based on the original files instead of our merged database. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the testing records.

We acknowledge Montana State University, Knowledge Centre Wind turbine Materials and Construction, and Mr. Sibrand Raijmaekers (LM Wind Power) for the databases.

Following are copyright contents from the original databases.
