# Machine Learning Benchmark Platform for Fatigue Life Prediction

It will be published as a public repository after acceptance.

## Usage

Bash scripts (e.g. `run.sh` and `run_thiswork.sh`) gives several examples to use the scripts (e.g. `main.py` and `main_thiswork.py`). It contains command lines to reproduce results in our paper.

## Requirements

This work is built on our developing open-source tabular prediction benchmark platform [`tabular_ensemble`](https://github.com/LuoXueling/tabular_ensemble). See the installation instruction there.

## Our environment

We run our experiments on a personal computer with Ubuntu 18.04, Intel Core i9-11900K, Nvidia RTX 3090. Results might differ on different devices/environments. We have verified main conclusions on Siyuan-1 cluster supported by the Center for High Performance Computing at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (with Nvidia A100 GPU). The environment and configurations for each trial can be seen in `log.txt`.
